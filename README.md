# Blaster Game

## Overview

This is a simple yet exciting Space Invaders implementation created using
Kotlin and the `Graphics2D` class. It serves as a demonstration of concepts
like game loops, graphics rendering and multithreading.

It does not use any kind of library or framework. I built this game with
just Kotlin, a `JFrame`, a `Canvas` and the `Graphics2D` class.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide a practical example for:

- Kotlin basics.
- `Graphics2D` rendering.
- Multithreading in `Swing` environments.

## Performance

**This game was not built with performance in mind.** I made it to perform
as good as it can, but it has not been well-tested.

*My local setup is a Nitro ANV15-51 with an i5-13420H with 40GB of RAM.*
